excerpt: 'descriptionOften the filters learned by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from different image datasets appear similar. This similarity of filters is often exploited for the purposes of transfer learning. This is also being used as an initialization technique for different tasks in the same dataset or for the same task in similar datasets. Off-the-shelf CNN features have capitalized on this idea to promote their networks as best transferable and most general and are used in a cavalier manner in day-to-day computer vision tasks. While the filters learned by these CNNs are related to the atomic structures of the images from which they are learnt, all datasets learn similar looking low-level filters. With the understanding that a dataset that contains many such atomic structures learn general filters and are therefore useful to initialize other networks with, we propose a way to analyse and quantify generality. We applied this metric on several popular character recognition, natural image and a medical image dataset, and arrive at some interesting conclusions. On further experimentation we also discovered that particular classes in a dataset themselves are more general than others.'
